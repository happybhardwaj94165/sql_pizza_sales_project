üçï Pizza Sales Data Analysis using SQL
Built a comprehensive SQL-based data analysis project to explore key insights from a fictional pizza store's sales database. The project involved data cleaning, aggregation, and advanced querying to uncover actionable business metrics, such as:

- Top-selling pizzas by revenue and quantity

- Peak order hours and days for staffing optimization

- Customer order patterns to support targeted promotions

- Average order value & pizza size contribution to overall sales

Utilized CTEs, window functions, date/time functions, and aggregate queries to derive insights. Designed queries to simulate real-world business reporting and performance dashboards. The project showcases strong command over SQL for data-driven decision making in the food & beverage domain.
